This project is part of Assignment 1 for BINF5507 at Humber Polytechnic.
Objective: to clean and preprocess a messy dataset using object-oriented programming. 
The assignment includes method development, data cleaning using `pandas`, and applying the preprocessing pipeline in a Jupyter notebook to improve data quality for future modeling.

Data/messy_data.csv: The provided messy dataset for preprocessing.

Scripts/data_preprocessor.py: implementation of the DataPreprocessor
script.
Scripts/main.ipynb: A notebook to test preprocessing methods, apply it to
messy_data.csv, and generate cleaned_data.csv.

README.md: Brief documentation describing project and instructions for running code.
