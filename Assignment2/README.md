This project is part of Assignment 2 for BINF5507 at Humber Polytechnic.
Objective: 
1. to train and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for regression and classification
2. Visualize and interpret hyperparameter effects
3. Reflect on model selection and insights


Include the Following:
● Data/heart_disease_uci.csv: The provided dataset.
● Scripts/main.ipynb: A notebook to implement both regression and classification models using the provided dataset.
● README.md: Brief documentation describing your project and instructions for running
your code

we will use the Heart Disease Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease

All the codes used referenced from lab materials and scikit-learn website as they are new concepts for me. 
The pipelines of this assignment are written by me yet suggested codes were referenced from partial VS built-in auto-code completion and chatGPT.
ChatGPT, 2025 was used to help me find functions for OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler, and error handling for heatmap plotting (new concepts)
Plots were created using lab materials
