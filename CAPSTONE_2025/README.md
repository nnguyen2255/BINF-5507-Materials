## Data Description
Dataset used: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset

Source: sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()

Features:

30 numeric features (e.g., radius, texture, smoothness)
Target: 0 = Malignant, 1 = Benign

Preprocessing steps:

Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Train-test split (80% training, 20% testing)

## Methodology
Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook


Steps:
    Data preprocessing
    Feature scaling
    Model implementation using Perceptron
    Performance evaluation
        Accuracy
        Precision, Recall, F1-score
        Confusion Matrix
Comparison with another model (e.g., Logistic Regression)
