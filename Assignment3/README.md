This is Assignment 3 for BINF5507 at Humber Polytechnic
This assignment was completed based on the Assignment Instruction and Rubric provided by the course. The structure and code were developed iterativelyâ€”starting with individual scripts per dataset before generalizing with loops for repetitive evaluations.


Resources used for this assignment include: 
    BINF5507 - Lab5.ipynb
    (for built-in function for plots and clustering functions)
    
    Scikit-learn.org:
    https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html
    (for definition and DBSCAN parameters and notes)

    Datacamp.com:

    (for DBSCAN guidance/steps and code structure examples)

    ChatGPT, 2025:
    (for error handling, code recommendations for subplots, and grammar checks/rephrasing responses)

    Auto-coding features in VS Code
    (for code refactoring suggestions, and repetitive tasks)

Coding Approach: 
All clustering models and evaluation functions were first drafted per dataset for clarity.

Final implementation includes looped routines for evaluating multiple clustering methods and datasets efficiently.

Visualizations were customized to ensure consistent comparison across models.
