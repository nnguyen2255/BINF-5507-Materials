This is Assignment 4 for BINF5507 at Humber Polytechnic

Objective:

This project applies survival analysis techniques to a clinical dataset of head and neck cancer patients. The goal is to evaluate and compare three key models:

    Kaplan-Meier survival analysis

    Cox Proportional Hazards regression

    Random Survival Forests (RSF)

These models are used to gain insight into time-to-event outcomes (e.g., survival times) and explore the clinical relevance of covariates such as age, treatment type, and tumor stage.
